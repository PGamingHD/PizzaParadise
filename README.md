# PizzaParadise

*Welcome to the Open-Source PizzaParadise project! This is where you can get your very own PizzaParadise files. This used to be a minigame bot, where the point is to collect as much Pizza as you could and then do stuff with the money gained from that. It was never finished, and eventually I did not have enough time to continue with the project. Therefore it was open-sourced for everyone to continue working and building on it. Please do note that in the License provided with this, it states that you must if using this still reference the original author of this project. (PGamingHD#0666) Not doing this will lead to legal issues, so please do not take it that far.*

**REQUIREMENTS:**
*Node.js 16.6.0+*
*MySQL server (Tested on 8.0.21)*

**SETUP:**

1. Replace all DB information in the config file to match with your MySQL server connection information [Host, password, username & DBname] (Please do note that this requires a mySQL server to be ran and available)

2. After done that, please fill in EVERYTHING else in the config file that needs to be added in there.

4. Done that? Now its time to install node packages! Please use the command line command `npm i` into the root (Where the index.js file is hosted) (Needs node.js installed)

6. Now it is time to setup the Database with all SQL files, please create a new Schema, then import all files found in the PizzaParadise-SQL folder into that Database, then it should be setup and ready for the next step!

8. After you have filled in config.json and installed all NODE.JS packages... You are more or less ready to test it out, if you have filled everything out correctly.. This should work and now turn on your bot, you are now able to host your own bot and should not have any issues with this. 

**UPDATING:**

*Now how do you add new commands? Simple, there are actually TEMPLATE.js commands made in slashcommands / commands folders made for easier usage here. You may ofc make your own commands but those can be to a bit of help when updating to add new commands.*
